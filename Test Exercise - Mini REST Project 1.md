Dear readers,

Greetings!

And Thank you for taking time to read through this description.

This is a description of the 2nd Task from ESG test pack - 
"Test Exercise - Mini REST Project 1".


* As this is a test task, I have taken a simplistic approach to many aspects in order to optimize for development time as this 30-60 minutes task took longer.
There are many things that can be improved further like Exception handling, validation, edge cases testing etc..
* I have tried to make reasonable compromises to delivery a working app with a good foundation for extension.

_____
I have 2 spring apps:
* EsgRestApplication.java that runs a Web Server accepting REST calls.
* EsgConsoleApplication.java that runs from a command line accepting .csv filename

____
I have used 
* Spring Boot framework with JPA for few code lines solution that suits this task
* MySQL database and created customer.sql script to set up a simple table.
* I have used opencsv library to read lines from *.csv with few lines of code.
* There is some test coverage for the important parts of the app.
